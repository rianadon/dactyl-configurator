List of External Holders for the Dactyl
====

While I personally don't use external holders, they are a popular way to securely fasten a microcontroller and connector to your keyboard, especially if you don't have access to a drill to widen the holes in the model.

If you're using one of these, make sure to set the connector type to *anything* but RJ9.
